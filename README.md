# quiz-app
Quiz App is a JavaScript, HTML, and CSS quiz game app. It was based off of a Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-quiz-app-with-html-css-and-javascript/
I changed the number of questions and made sure that any HTML codes for symbols would appear correctly for the questions and answers that were fetched from the Open Trivia DB API.
It is currently set to gather 10 random general knowledge questions of any difficulty from that API as long as they are multiple choice questions.
